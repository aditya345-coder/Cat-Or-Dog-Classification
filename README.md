## Overview

This project is focused on classifying images into two categories: "Car" or "Dog." The dataset used for this classification task is obtained from Kaggle, and you can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV (cv2)
  - Matplotlib
- Streamlit (for creating a web interface)

## Project Description

In this project, I developed an image classification model using machine learning techniques to distinguish between car and dog images. The project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, model development, training, and creating a user-friendly web interface with Streamlit.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the application in your web browser.

- The `models` directory stores the trained classification model.

## Web Interface

The user interface for this project is created using Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the image classification model. Users can upload their own images and get real-time predictions.
